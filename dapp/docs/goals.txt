This week I'm going to work on a hello world dapp.  Here's what I intend to
produce.  Items are in priority order, will do as many as time permits.

[X] a public repo for the helloworld app (andyl/dhello)
[X] a solidity contract that fetches and returns items from a blockchain message store
[X] a web3 integration that depends on Chrome/MetaMask
[X] a HTML form that allows the user to post a message to the store
[ ] a HTML page to display the message log
[X] add bootstrap V4 as the CSS framework
[X] add react/redux components as needed
[X] add test framework 
    (unit tests for contracts and components, integration tests for HTML interface)
[X] add a webpack configuration for JS, HTML and Contract generation
[X] add a TMUX configuration for a multi-process dev console 
    (test runner, web server, webpack watcher, ethereum development node)
[-] a pure HTML implementation using server-side Truffle for blockchain access

At the end of this process I hope to understand:

- the types of data structures provided by solidity
- web3 mechanisms for identity and authorization
- unit testing for web3 interactions and solidity contracts
- web3 integration testing
- pros and cons of metamind vs truffle integration

Notes:
[ ] 

TODO:
[ ] deploy the app to GitHub pages
[ ] add Jest tests
[ ] add integration tests
[ ] is it possible to show the account ID in the dapp?
