## Code Documentation

We use `yard` as our document generation tool.  

We prefer to keep our in-line comments light weight.  Please follow the rails
guidelines for API documentation, and add usage comments to each class which is
'public facing' or of general importance.  Don't worry about documenting each
method, especially for internal classes.
